This contains an adaptation of Tomi Valkeinen's MonoCo to use the
version of the Continuations API that was introduced into Mono as
Mono.Tasklets.

The original MonoCo lives here:

Mono.Tasklets was inspired in the implementation from Tomi that the
Mono team will be maintaining in Mono's code base.
